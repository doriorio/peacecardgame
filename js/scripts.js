//A countdown displays and if there are two clicks (one per player) on the arena, the click listener is activated

//Looks at the value of both cards and compares (this will be programmatically generated based on  card number)

// Both characters get three cards that go on their side of the "arena" - then they flip over a fourth card and whoever has the lowest value (the "peace" variation) wins all 10 cards (original 2 + )

////
// _if_ there aren't enough cards for all for the mediation requirements, they can use whatever they have left
